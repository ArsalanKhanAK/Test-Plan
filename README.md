## Test Plans

This section includes various **Test Plans** for different software applications. Each Test Plan provides an overview of the testing approach and outlines the following:

- **Testing Objectives**: What aspects of the application will be verified.
- **Scope**: The boundaries of the testing process, including what is in-scope and out-of-scope.
- **Testing Approach**: Describes whether manual, automated, or both approaches will be used.
- **Testing Tools**: List of tools and technologies used for testing (e.g., Selenium, JUnit, etc.).
- **Resources**: Information about the team, testing environments, and timelines.

Test Plans ensure that all aspects of the application are covered and that testing is structured and efficient.
